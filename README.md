# Feed Reader Testing using Jasmine

## What is this project all about?

In this project I have performed unit testing on a RSS feed reader application using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) which is a javaScript testing framework.

## What exactly is Jasmine?

Jasmine is an open source testing framework for JavaScript. It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled platform, to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax. It is heavily influenced by other unit testing frameworks, such as ScrewUnit, JSSpec, JSpec, and RSpec.
